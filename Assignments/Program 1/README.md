## P01 - Fraction Class
### Jesus Mendoza

### Description:
This project implements a `Fraction` class in C++ that allows for basic arithmetic operations between fractions using operator overloading. You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions by using the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators. It also supports comparing fractions for equality with the `==` operator. The class simplifies fractions to their lowest terms automatically and ensures the denominator is positive. Special cases, like division by zero, are handled to avoid runtime errors.

### Instructions

- Make sure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` or `clang++` installed on your system. I made the mistake of trying to use regular clang and it wouldn't compile
